We commit to providing a positive experience to all participants. We emphasize that we will not tolerate any power abuse and bullying including but not limited to the ones based on race, gender, religion, social class, gender identity, sexual orientation, and other forms of identity. We will proactively take a stance against any form of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation. We will follow the revised NeurIPS guidelines which can be reviewed at https://neurips.cc/public/CodeOfConduct.  

Please contact us at `imbm.dltheory@gmail.com` with any questions, concerns, or reporting.
