    Crash courses are accessible to undergraduates and people who would like a basic refresher, they cover basic toolbox in mathematics and physics that are necessary building blocks for modern machine learning. History of computing session will include a Q&A. Tutorials present an introduction but they will quickly penetrate deeper into the subject and cover modern applications. The Keynote Seminar will present cutting edge issues in Deep Learning.
