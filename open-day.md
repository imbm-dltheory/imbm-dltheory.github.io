Crash courses are accessible to undergraduates and people who would like a basic refresher, they cover basic toolbox in mathematics and physics that are necessary building blocks for modern machine learning. The history of computing session will include a lengthy Q&A. Tutorials present an introduction but quickly will penetrate deeper into the subject and cover modern applications. The _Keynote Seminar_ will present cutting edge issues in Deep Learning today.
